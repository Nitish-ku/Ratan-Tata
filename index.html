          <h2>Titan of Indian Industry</h2>
          <p>
            <b>Ratan Naval Tata</b> (28 December 1937 – Present) is an Indian
            industrialist and philanthropist, renowned for his visionary
            leadership in shaping the Tata Group, one of India’s largest and
            most respected conglomerates. He served as the chairman of Tata
            Sons, the holding company of the Tata Group, from 1990 to 2012, and
            again as interim chairman from 2016 to 2017. Born in Mumbai,
            Maharashtra, Ratan Tata studied architecture at Cornell University
            and pursued an advanced management program at Harvard Business
            School.
          </p>
          <p>
            Under his leadership, the Tata Group made significant strides in
            expanding its global footprint, acquiring iconic international
            brands such as Jaguar Land Rover, Tetley Tea, and Corus Steel, while
            also strengthening its presence in diverse sectors such as
            automobiles, technology, steel, and consumer goods. He was
            instrumental in launching the Tata Nano, the world’s most affordable
            car, and played a key role in transforming the group into a global
            powerhouse. Ratan Tata is widely regarded for his integrity,
            humility, and commitment to ethical business practices.

            Ratan Tata's philanthropic contributions are equally commendable.
            Through the Tata Trusts, he has supported a wide array of social
            initiatives aimed at improving healthcare, education, and rural
            development across India. He remains deeply committed to social
            welfare, making a lasting impact on the lives of millions of people.
